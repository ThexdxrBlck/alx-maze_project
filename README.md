## Project Overview
   *  The goal of this project is to create a 3D game using raycasting. The project involves creating a window with SDL2, implementing raycasting to draw walls, and allowing for camera angle adjustments.

- Installation
 Clone the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThexdxrBlck/alx-maze_project.git
   cd alx-maze_project
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -o *.c maze
   ./maze
NOTE: you might experience challenges running the executable file if your container does not support SDL2 e.g `No Video Device Found`, so stick to a more suitable IDE like `Visual Studio`.
### Usage
`Run the compiled executable and enjoy the 3D game experience`.
### Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the project, follow these steps:
`Fork the repository`.
`Create a new branch`.
